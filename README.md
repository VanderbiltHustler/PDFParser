### Vanderbilt Hustler internal tool to convert PDFs to spreadsheets!

## How this tool works
This Python script uses the tabula library to read a PDF, build it into a dataframe, and export it as a csv. For pdfs with multiple tables, the script outputs each table as separate sheets. 

## How to use this tool
1. Add your PDF file to the repository. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file into the folder.

2. Add an empty Excel file to the repository. You can do this by right-clicking on the file explorer and selecting New File. Name the file with the .xlsx extension.

3. Run the Python script using the command
```bash
python pdf_to_excel.py
```

## Things being worked through/considered
- Example PDFs
  - https://police.vanderbilt.edu/pdfs/Daily_Crime_Log.pdf
  - https://police.vanderbilt.edu/crimeinfo/annual-security-report.pdf
- React-Typescript, perhaps with Flask for the Python backend
  - [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60528792/how-to-combine-javascript-react-frontend-and-python-backend](url)
- Will assign components; however, frontend is focus for now

- Doesn't need to store PDFs, but may need to turn Excel sheets into Google Sheets
  - Google Sheets API [https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts](url) 

## Possible Requirements
(Will be workshopped -- consider a requirements.txt)

- pip install tabula-py
- pip install JPype1
- Install Java 64-Bit @ [https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](url)
- Add it to your environment variabls
- Add it to your path (%JAVA_HOME%\bin)
- e.g. "(C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_421)"
- pip install openpyxl

## Directory 
install tree (mac example shown)
```bash
brew install tree
```
use tree command in terminal to generate
```bash
tree -I 'node_modules|.git' --dirsfirst | pbcopy
```
