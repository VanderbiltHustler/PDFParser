# PDFParser
Vanderbilt Hustler internal tool to convert PDFs to spreadsheets!

#Python script using the tabula library that reads a PDF, builds it into a dataframe, and exports it as a csv, a high-demand tool from our 150+ person reporting staff because data from PDFs is very time intensive to input into spreadsheets without access to costly products. For pdfs with multiple tables, the script outputs each table as separate sheets.
